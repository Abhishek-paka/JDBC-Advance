# JDBC Project

This project demonstrates the usage of JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to interact with a database and perform advanced queries.

## Project Description

The JDBC project showcases the following features:

- Connecting to a database using JDBC.
- Executing SQL queries and retrieving results.
- Performing advanced queries involving joins, aggregations, and subqueries.
- Demonstrating error handling and exception management in JDBC.
- Providing a sample database schema for reference.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/model/` - Contains the Java source code files.
- `lib/` - Contains the JDBC driver library.
- `database/` - Contains the Database sql Script
## Usage

1. Set up a database and import the provided SQL script to create the necessary schema and populate sample data.

2. Configure the JDBC connection properties in the project's source code.

3. Build and run the project using a Java IDE or command line.

4. Follow the prompts to execute various advanced queries and observe the results.

## Advanced Queries

The project demonstrates the following advanced queries:

1. [Join Query](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-join-set-1-inner-left-right-and-full-joins/): Performs a join operation between multiple tables to retrieve related data.

2. [Aggregation Query](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/aggregate-functions-in-sql/): Utilizes aggregate functions COUNT to calculate statistical information.

3. [Subquery](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-join-set-1-inner-left-right-and-full-joins/): Uses a subquery to retrieve data based on a nested query within the main query.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to experiment with different queries and database configurations.

## Dependencies

The project depends on the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.1 or later but developed on version 17.0.2
- JDBC driver for your specific database (included in the `lib/` directory).
